Description: Socket acceptor pool for TCP protocols.
 Ranch is a socket acceptor pool for TCP protocols.
 .
 Ranch aims to provide everything you need to accept
 TCP connections with a small code base and low latency
 while being easy to use directly as an application or
 to embed into your own.
 .
 Ranch provides a modular design, letting you choose
 which transport and protocol are going to be used for
 a particular listener. Listeners accept and manage
 connections on one port, and include facilities to
 limit the number of concurrent connections. Connections
 are sorted into pools, each pool having a different
 configurable limit.
 .
 Ranch also allows you to upgrade the acceptor pool
 without having to close any of the currently opened
 sockets.
